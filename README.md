<h1><b>Shopping App</b></h1>

This application is a modern online store built using HTML, CSS, React, and TypeScript, integrated with a product API. It allows users to browse through various products and seamlessly add them to either their cart or favorites. The application leverages localStorage to ensure that items added to the cart or favorites are persisted even after refreshing the page.

Users can adjust the quantity of items in the cart, remove items, or completely clear the cart if needed. At checkout, there is a payment form that enables users to finalize their purchases. The form is user-friendly, validating input to ensure proper submission.

The application is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth user experience across all devices, including smaller screens like smartphones and tablets. The layout dynamically adapts to different screen sizes, making it easy to browse and shop from any device.
